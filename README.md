# ViralDiffusionVisualizationTool
This tool uses quantum computing to create a visualization of viral diffusion, building on a concept discussed in this paper (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/que2.29). Each Qubit in the visualization corresponds to a population with a chance of being infected and is represented by a circle with its infection probability represented by its shade of red. As the infection probability increases in a Qubit, its corresponding node darkens. With more time, we would also allow for the implementation of social distancing and mask wearing which would help decrease the spread of the virus.
